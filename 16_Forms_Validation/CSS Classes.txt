CSS Classes

AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states.

The following classes are added to, or removed from, input fields:

    ng-untouched The field has not been touched yet
    ng-touched The field has been touched
    ng-pristine The field has not been  modified yet
    ng-dirty The field has been modified
    ng-valid The field content is valid
    ng-invalid The field content is not valid
    ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
    ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required

The following classes are added to, or removed from, forms:

    ng-pristine No fields has not been modified yet
    ng-dirty One or more fields has been modified
    ng-valid The form content is valid
    ng-invalid The form content is not valid
    ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
    ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required

The classes are removed if the value they represent is false.
