<!-- 
In HTML, the new directive will be referred to by using the attribute my-directive.

In the JavaScript we start by adding a new directive named myDirective.

Remember, when naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, myDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, my-directive.

Then, return an object where you specify that we require  ngModel, which is the ngModelController.

Make a linking function which takes some arguments, where the fourth argument, mCtrl, is the ngModelController,

Then specify a function, in this case named myValidation, which takes one argument, this argument is the value of the input element.

Test if the value contains the letter "e", and set the validity of the model controller to either true or false.

At last, mCtrl.$parsers.push(myValidation); will add the myValidation function to an array of other functions, which will be executed every time the input value changes. -->
