Form Validation

AngularJS offers client-side form validation.

AngularJS monitors the state of the form and input fields (input, textarea, select), and lets you notify the user about the current state.

AngularJS also holds information about whether they have been touched, or modified, or not.

You can use standard HTML5 attributes to validate input, or you can make your own validation functions.

Client-side validation cannot alone secure user input. Server side validation is also necessary.
