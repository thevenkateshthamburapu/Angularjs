You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives:

    ng-blur
    ng-change
    ng-click
    ng-copy
    ng-cut
    ng-dblclick
    ng-focus
    ng-keydown
    ng-keypress
    ng-keyup
    ng-mousedown
    ng-mouseenter
    ng-mouseleave
    ng-mousemove
    ng-mouseover
    ng-mouseup
    ng-paste

The event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.

An AngularJS event will not overwrite an HTML event, both events will be executed.
