ng-include directive is used to embed an HTML page into another HTML page. This technique is extremely useful when you want to reuse a specific view in multiple pages in your application. 

The value of ng-include directive can be the name of the HTML page that you want to reuse or a property on the $scope object that points to the reusable HTML page.
