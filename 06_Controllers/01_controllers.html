		AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications.
		AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects. -->
		
		<!--
		AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers.
		The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.
		A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor. -->

		<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
			First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br>
			Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br>
			<br>
			Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}
		</div>

		<!-- The AngularJS application is defined by  ng-app="myApp". The application runs inside the <div>.
		The ng-controller="myCtrl" attribute is an AngularJS directive. It defines a controller.
		The myCtrl function is a JavaScript function.
		AngularJS will invoke the controller with a $scope object.
		In AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions).
		The controller creates two properties (variables) in the scope (firstName and lastName).
		The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties (firstName and lastName). -->
