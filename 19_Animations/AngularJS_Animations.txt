What is an Animation?

An animation is when the transformation of an HTML element gives you an illusion of motion.

What Does ngAnimate Do?

The ngAnimate module adds and removes classes.

The ngAnimate module does not animate your HTML elements, but when ngAnimate notice certain events, like hide or show of an HTML element, the element gets some pre-defined classes which can be used to make animations.

The directives in AngularJS who add/remove classes are:

    ng-show
    ng-hide
    ng-class
    ng-view
    ng-include
    ng-repeat
    ng-if
    ng-switch

The ng-show and ng-hide directives adds or removes a ng-hide class value.

The other directives adds a ng-enter class value when they enter the DOM, and a ng-leave attribute when they are removed from the DOM.

The ng-repeat directive also adds a ng-move class value when the HTML element changes position.

In addition, during the animation, the HTML element will have a set of class values, which will be removed when the animation has finished. Example: the ng-hide directive will add these class values:

    ng-animate
    ng-hide-animate
    ng-hide-add (if the element will be hidden)
    ng-hide-remove (if the element will be showed)
    ng-hide-add-active (if the element will be hidden)
    ng-hide-remove-active (if the element will be showed)
