The ng-repeat directive repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array, it can be used to create options in a dropdown list, but the ng-options directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with options, and has at least one important advantage:

Dropdowns made with ng-options allows the selected value to be an object, while dropdowns made from ng-repeat has to be a string.
The ng-repeat directive has its limitations, the selected value must be a string.
When using the ng-options directive, the selected value can be an object.
When the selected value can be an object, it can hold more information, and your application can be more flexible.
