**The ng-app Directive**

The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.

The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.

**The ng-init Directive**

The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.

Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead.

You will learn more about controllers and modules later.

**The ng-model Directive**

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-model directive can also:

    Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
    Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
    Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
    Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
